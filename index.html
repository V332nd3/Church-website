	        <h2>Paul & Yemi Olujobi are the parish Pastors</h2>
	        <p>They’re passionate about creating an environment where everyone feels loved and valued. They’re also passionate about the gospel message and their style of delivering this message is through servant leadership. They’re on a mission to build leaders and they believe that everyone created by God is born with the seed of greatness and leadership. They help people discover their purpose and calling and encourage everyone to use their God-given gifts to God’s glory and for the good of humanity. They’re generous givers and believe that there’s nothing one cannot give for God. They thrive on prayers and know that everything the church & individuals do and accomplish can only be through the power of prayer. They’re building a love community such that anyone who visits the church would be met by the strong reality of God’s love and be enveloped by God’s saving grace, peace and joy. They’re very approachable and friendly, good communicators with great interpersonal skills reaching out intergenerationally & inter-culturally. They encourage the display of individual gifts and talents as they believe that every believer has a God-given ability waiting to be expressed.</p>
